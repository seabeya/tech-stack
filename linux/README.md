### ðŸ”· Command Chaining

- `cmd1 ; cmd2 ; cmd3`: Run commands in order, regardless of success.

- `cmd1 && cmd2 && cmd3`: Run next only if the previous succeeds.

- `cmd1 || cmd2 || cmd3`: Run next only if the previous fails.

- `cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3`: Pipe output of one command to the next.

```

<br>

## ðŸ”¶ Permissions

Understanding the file and directory permission system in Linux.

<br>

### ðŸ”· Overview

Permissions determine who can access, modify, or execute files and directories, and ensure that users and programs can only interact with the system in permitted ways.

<br>

#### ðŸ”» Permission Types

Permission types determine what kind of access a user (or program) has to a file or directory.

- Read (`r`):
  > View file contents or list a directory's contents.
- Write (`w`):
  > Modify file contents or add/remove files in a directory.
- Execute (`x`):
  > Run a file as a program or enter a directory.

<br>

#### ðŸ”» Ownership

Ownership determines who has control over a file or directory.

- User (`u`):
  > The owner of the file or directory (usually the creator).
- Group (`g`):
  > Members of a group associated with the file or directory.
- Others (`o`):
  > Everyone else on the system.

<br>

<p align="right">
  <a href="#linux-debian">back to top â¬†</a>
</p>

<br>

### ðŸ”· Structure

The permission structure is represented in a 10-character string, such as `-rwxr-xr--`, which can be broken down as follows:

<p align="center">
  <b>[identifier] [owner] [group] [others]</b>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <b>- rwx r-x r--</b>
</p>

- Identifier: The 1st char.
  - `-`: File.
  - `d`: Directory.
  - `l`: Symbolic link.
- User/Group/Others: Combination of 3 chars each.
  - `r`: Read.
  - `w`: Write.
  - `x`: Execute.
  - `-`: No permission.

<br>

#### ðŸ”» Octal Representation

The permission structure can also be represented in octal format, where each permission type is assigned a number:

- `r`: 4
- `w`: 2
- `x`: 1
- `-`: 0

A complete table:

| Octal | Binary | File Mode |
| ----- | ------ | --------- |
| 0     | 000    | ---       |
| 1     | 001    | --x       |
| 2     | 010    | -w-       |
| 3     | 011    | -wx       |
| 4     | 100    | r--       |
| 5     | 101    | r-x       |
| 6     | 110    | rw-       |
| 7     | 111    | rwx       |

> Example: `-rwxr-xr--` translated as `754`.
>
> - `7` for the owner (`rwx`).
> - `5` for the group (`r-x`).
> - `4` for others (`r--`).
