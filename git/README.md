<h1 align="center">Git</em></h1>

<p align="center">
  Git is the world's most popular version control system that helps teams work together on projects. It tracks changes to files over time, allowing multiple people to collaborate efficiently. And I have tried to cover almost everything about it here.

#### Knowledge requirements

- No previous knowledge is required!

## ðŸ”¶ Configuration

- Configure the name and email that Git will associate with your work (required before start).
  - `git config --global user.name "[Name]"`
  - `git config --global user.email "[Email]"`
    > (Optional): If you want to keep your email private, you can use the email provided by GitHub. You can find it in your GitHub settings. For example, mine is 35802638+shaanaliyev@users.noreply.github.com.
    > Without the '--global' option, the configuration will be applied locally to the current repository (you need an initialized repository to do this).
- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository in a directory.
  > When you run this command in a folder, it sets up all the necessary files and directories that Git needs to start tracking changes in your project. _(You need this once per project.)_
