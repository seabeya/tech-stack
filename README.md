  <em>
    After seeing my friends' interest in my notes and reflecting on my own experience of using them (keeping them in Word/PDF format is not that efficient in terms of accessibility and ease of use), I have come to the idea that it would be nice if I combine them under one roof and publish them on GitHub by creating a documentation style repository.
