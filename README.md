  Some of my notes.

  <em>
    After seeing my friends' interest in my notes and reflecting on my own experience of using them (keeping them in Word/PDF format is not that efficient in terms of accessibility and ease of use), I have come to the idea that it would be nice if I combine them under one roof and publish them on GitHub by creating a documentation style repository.

> [!NOTE]
> The original notes are in a different file format and are not in English. Therefore, it will take some time to refactor and publish them.
>
> - `planned ⚫`: I have notes but haven't migrated them to Markdown yet.
> - `in-progress 🟡`: The migration process has started but is not finished yet.
> - `🟢`: Migration is finished, and the old note files have been removed, making these the main source of truth for me.

> [!NOTE]
> I use these notes on a daily basis and update them regularly as I learn new things or as technology evolves to keep them relevant.
